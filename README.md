## FAQ

### How do I add entries?
The Google Drive Extension *only* supports google drive folder Name `echomusic`, so no shared drives and Everything inside a `echomusic` folder Inside only it will be Detected by Extension . To Create `Playlist` inside echomusic ==> make a folder and inside Add all your Song in APP it will show up as PLaylists


```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/echomusic
├── playlistFolder/
│   ├── Music.mp3
│   ├── song.mp4
│   └── ...
├── Music.mp3
├── movie/song 2.mp4
└── ...
```
### I cannot log in through webview
Keep Retrying It will Work
